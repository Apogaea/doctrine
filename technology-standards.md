# Potential Tech

* [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) : 
  * Runs under LAMP, which most webhosts have available [koda]
  * One of the cleaner, more modern, and more complete PHP Frameworks [koda]
  * Much friendlier to use than CakePHP or Zend [koda]
  
* [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  * Aaron, why is Djano a good choice?
  
* [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)
  * Because it makes javascript work easier. [koda]
  * Maybe [JQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) should be standard also?
