# Potential Tech

- [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) : 
  - Runs under LAMP, which most webhosts have available [koda]
  - One of the cleaner, more modern, and more complete PHP Frameworks [koda]
  - Much friendlier to use than CakePHP or Zend [koda]
  
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  - Most of these *bonuses* could be said about Rails or other modern
    Frameworks.  I however work with Django on a daily basis in a professional
    environment and am extremely proficient at using it to build web
    applications.
  - Python
    - Python is a pleasure to write and work with and is easy to learn.
  - [Testable](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/#the-development-process)
    - If we are to collaboratively develop applications, they need to be
      testable.  Otherwise, it is unpractical to contribute to someone elses
      code since it can be very difficult to know if you are breaking
      something.
  - [Well Documented](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/)
    - Django has fantastic documentation.  A motivated developer should have no
      problem getting acquainted with the Django ecosystem.
  - [Admin interface included](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/#the-admin)
  - [Schema Migrations](http://south.aeracode.org/)
  - [Rich 3rd Party Ecosystem](https://www.djangopackages.com/)
    - There are 3rd party solutions to most common application needs.
  - [Security](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/security/#security-in-django)
    - [ORM protects against SQL injection](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/security/#sql-injection-protection).
    - [CSRF Protection](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/security/#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection)
    - [XSS Protection](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/security/#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf-protection)
  - Batteries Included
    - [ORM rather than writing SQL](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/)
    - [User accounts and authentication](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/auth/)
    - [Sending Emails](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/email/)
    - [Forms and Validation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/#forms)
    - [Lots More](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/#common-web-application-tools)

  
- [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)
  - Because it makes javascript work easier. [koda]
  - Maybe [JQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) should be standard also?
- [AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org/) or [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) [aaronmerriam]:
  - For a sufficiently large application, JQuery can become unmanageable.  In
    these situations, consider using one of these Javascript Frameworks.
  - Even small applications can benefit greatly from the tools these frameworks
    provide.
- [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) [aaronmerriam]
  - Provides a standard library for doing things the *right* way.
  - Standard Operations on:
    - [Arrays](http://underscorejs.org/#arrays)
    - [Collections](http://underscorejs.org/#collections)
    - [Objects](http://underscorejs.org/#objects)
